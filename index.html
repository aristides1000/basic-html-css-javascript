    <h1>This is a first level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into red color</h1>
    <h2>this is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into blue color</h2>
    <h3>this is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into green color</h3>
    <p>This is a <em>paragraph</em> As you can see, I placed an emphasis on the word "paragraph". Now I will change also the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its text color to green, all with just css.</p>
